Hilo
Are you willing to risk everything? Play Hilo and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. A card from 1 to 13 will appear and you guess if the next card will be higher or lower.

You begin with 300 points. If your Hilo prediction is correct you add 100 points to your score. If your Hilo prediciton is incorrect you subtract 75 points from your score.

If you are still wanting to play Hilo you are able to guess again. However, if you get to 0 points it is GAME OVER for you. Play as long as you like and make as many guesses of Hilo as you choose. Good luck and happy predictions!
